# Moot is an MVC framework and CMS
It implements an MVC system design following the opinions that controllers should not be responsible for determining which views are paired with which models. Instead, the concept of containers are used to construct the trio. The point of doing this promotes model and controller reusability.

### SPA support
Moot enables wiring frontend containers to backend containers through the use of model serialization.
